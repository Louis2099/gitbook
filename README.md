# ðŸ‘‹ Intro to the Hacker Fab

## the manifesto.

### **In just eight months,**&#x20;

students ranging from freshmen to PhDs went from an empty room with cardboard boxes of equipment to a nanofab facility capable of making functioning transistors.

How can an industry demand the continuation of Moore's Law without students who invent new approaches, particularly when gaining hands-on experience requires access to immutable million dollar equipment?

\


### **The Hacker Fab**&#x20;

designs, builds, and documents low cost open-source nanofab equipment. Every step in the nanofabrication process can be perpetually experimented with and modified. You contribute and make the Hacker Fab more capable and cheaper.&#x20;

\


### **The Hacker Fab can be adapted to:**

* Countless trailing edge nodes and research projects
* Designing specific new machines alongside novel device research
* An end-to-end semiconductor education platform
*
  * Accessible and hands-on for undergrads + highschoolers
  * Low cost for institutions
  * No clean room + minimal safety training

### **We want to accelerate.**

The entire Hacker Fab network benefits from improvements made by another individual or institution. This includes process data, CAD, software, education materials, and more. Progress means large reductions in cost, lowering the barrier to entry for new collaborators to join. It will not be possible to push the capabilities of a singular Hacker Fab towards more modern complexity without collaboration.&#x20;

This initiative was started in 2022 by Sam Zeloof, Elio Bourcart, and Alexander Hakim at Carnegie Mellon University. Thanks to the tremendous support by the Electrical and Computer Engineering department, the first course ran in the Spring of 2023.&#x20;
