## Purpose

The primary use of the tube furnace is for diffusion of dopant atoms into silicon. This introduces charge carriers, increasing the conductivity of the diffused region and making it either N or P type. Diffusion of a solid into another solid is quite slow, so high temperatures and long times are needed, hence the high-temperature tube furnace.

Many types of dopant sources are used, including solid, liquid, and glass. Our process uses spin on glass containing phosphorus for N doping and boron for P doping.

## Tools

1. Tube Furnace ([ThermoFisher Manual](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZI5JLqLPNKlWIGWCSD1lCgYlSFpEnkOj/view?usp=sharing)) with fused silica tube
2. Fused silica rod
3. Fused silica microscope slide

## Materials

1. Chip with glass containing phosphorus or boron.

## Procedure

### Pre-heating the Furnace

1. Turn on the furnace.&#x20;
2. Press and hold ‚Äúset/ent‚Äù for three seconds until ‚Äúmode res‚Äù is showing. Press the up arrow twice until mode ‚ÄúLCL‚Äù is selected. Press ‚Äúenter‚Äù once. Now the furnace will hold the temperature shown. Use the arrow keys to adjust and press ‚Äúenter‚Äù once to set the setpoint.&#x20;
3. Wait \~15 min for the furnace to come to temperature.
4. If the furnace stops and holds at a lower temperature than your setpoint, the high temperature alarm may be too low. Read the instructions on [page 6-7](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZI5JLqLPNKlWIGWCSD1lCgYlSFpEnkOj/view?usp=sharing) to fix this.

### Inserting chips

1.  Put the <mark style="background-color:yellow;">fused silica</mark> microscope slide in the entrance of the tube. Do not use a regular microscope slide, or it will melt inside the tube.

    1. Do NOT use borosilicate slides or other microscope slides. If the slide has a green tiny on the edges, it is NOT for use in the tube furnace.

1. Place your chips on the slide.
2. Use the glass rod to push the slide into the exact center of the tube, being careful to not scratch the inside of the tube too much.
3. Place the rod aside.

### Removing chips

1. Use the glass rod to push the slide to the end of the tube.
2. Wait a few minutes for the slide to cool down.
3. Use metal tweezers to take the slide out.

## Safety

The furnace is obviously very hot. Keep away from any hot parts of the furnace. The rod will heat up in the few seconds that it is inside the tube, so when removing it, only hold it by the end.

The rod and tube also channel heat out of their ends via internal reflection of radiation.
