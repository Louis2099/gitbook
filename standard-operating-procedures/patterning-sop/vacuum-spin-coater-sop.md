## Purpose

To apply a thin layer of wet chemicals to the surface of the chip, with sub-micron control.&#x20;

## Procedure

1. Plug in the Spin coater and the vacuum pump (if either is not able to power on try hitting ‚Äúreset‚Äù on the outlet)
2. Use the arrows on the touch screen to set the spin time and rpm
3. Use tweezers to place wafer onto the o-ring so that the chip completely covers the o-ring and will seal onto it
   1. Also attempt to center the chip on the o-ring as best you can. This will minimize the chances of it flying off.
4. Use a pipette to apply liquid on top of the wafer while it is seated in the spin coater
5. Close the lid
6. SWITCH ON THE VACUUM PUMP!
7. Press ‚Äúbegin‚Äù
   1. This will begin a pre spin at 600 rpm
8. Press ‚Äúcoat‚Äù
9. When the spin time has been reached, the coater will automatically ramp down to rest
10. Open the lid and remove the wafer with tweezers

## Side Notes

If you hear the spin coater constantly beeping, this is normal. It does this because we are using a drone motor ESC, so it is programmed to make a noise after being at rest for a few minutes. It‚Äôs trying to help you find it üôÇ

Feel free to turn it off using the switch in the front so the noise goes away.
