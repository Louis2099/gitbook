# Hot Plate Manual

## Purpose

Soft baking photoresist and annealing spin on glass.

## Best Practices

1. Mark a single location on hot plate to place chip every time
   1. Very inconsistent heating zones on most hot plates. These are not manufactured for 1cm^2 chip heating, original purpose is for heating of large beakers and liquids.

2. Characterize ramp up time for different process steps and take note in process data
   1. Some hot plates allow for controlled temperature ramping

## Operating Instructions&#x20;

### Heating

1. Plug in the hot plate, it should beep, light up the screen, then go dark.
2. Switch the hot plate on, it should light up and display both current temperature, and a pending set temperature.
3. Turn the knob until the desired set temperature is present, hold the knob down until it beeps to set the desired temperature.&#x20;
   1. A small green circle should appear at the set temperature
4. The screen should alternate between set temperature and current temperature, ensuring that the current temperature is increasing.

### Increasing Set Temperature While Operating

1. Hold the knob down until the set temperature is canceled.
   1. The small green circle should turn off.
2. Turn the knob to your new desired temperature, hold the knob down until it beeps to set the desired temperature.&#x20;
