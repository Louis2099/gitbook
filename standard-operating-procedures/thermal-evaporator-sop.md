# Thermal Evaporator SOP

***

## Purpose

Thermal evaporation heats up a metal (in this case Aluminum) to really hot temperatures in order to evaporate it onto the chip. Evaporating metals like aluminum is what allows us to conduct electricity through our design.

***

## Procedure

1. Make sure the vacuum has been turned off for at least 5 minutes
2. Make sure pressure is at room pressure (~1000 hPa). If it is not, slowly open the valve (black knob on the right side of the vacuum) and release pressure one order of magnitude about every 15 seconds
3. Turn the two black knobs on the top of the blue box and open the lid
4. Unscrew any screws holding down the Tungsten coil and remove the coil
5. Tightly wrap aluminum around the Tungsten coil. This alloy is brittle so be careful and don't wrap too tightly if you have less aluminum you need to evaporate
6. Place Tungsten back and screw it in. Make sure it is straight
7. Put the yellow tape on the square box attached to the inside of the lid then peel off the clear layer on top of the tape
- Since aluminum often covers the square box, when you put the tape on, aluminum might stick to it and flake off and so you might lose grip. If the tape isn't sticking because of this, just do it again
8. Put your chip on the yellow tape
9. Double check that the metal sheet at the back is not bent and still covering the vacuum
10. Close the blue lid and screw the black knobs all the way
11. Close the vent all the way
12. Turn on the pump
13. Screw the black knobs more since they tend to loosen after the pump turns on
14. Wait for the pressure on the screen to get under 1e-5 hPa. This will take 30 min - 1 hr depending on how clean the inside of the chamber is (Baking the chips and trying not to touch the inside of the chamber too much will help speed this up)
15. Turn on the power source
16. Press start on the computer
17. Turn up the current on the power source. Keep adjusting the current to keep the rate between 30-100 Angstroms/second until the thickness hits 5 Angstroms
- If you click the dial, you can change the digit.
- You will probably end up between 40-50 Amps. 
- The voltage and power will automatically change as you adjust the current so you do not need to worry about it.
- The pressure might increase to 1e-4 which is not a problem
- You may not get to 5 Angstroms so keep turning up the current but after 5 minutes, if you keep increasing past 55 Amps and it does not increase, the aluminum has probably already melted off. It is not a huge deal if the layer is thin but it is not ideal
18. After the thickness hits 5 Angstroms, turn off the power source
19. Press stop on the computer program
20. Turn off the vacuum pump. WAIT at least 5 minutes
21. After 5 minutes, slowly open the valve (black knob on the right side of the vacuum) and release pressure one order of magnitude about every 15 seconds
