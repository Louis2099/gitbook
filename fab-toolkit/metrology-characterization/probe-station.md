## Software



## Probing the Chip

#### Connections

1. If not using the tester adapter, connect W2 to the Gate probe and W1 to the Drain probe.&#x20;
2. The Source and Body probes must be connected to GND.
3. The +1 & -1 connections should be connected around the drain resistor.&#x20;
4.  \+2 should be connected to the Drain terminal.&#x20;

### To-do:

Add images with the connections, more specifics.

* simple mechanical probe manipulator
* needs 4 probes (show where each of them are used)
