## Hardware Description

Describe your hardware, highlighting the customization rather than the steps involved in the procedure. Explain how it differs from other hardware  and the advantages it offers over pre-existing methods. For example, how does this hardware compare to other hardware in terms of cost or ease of use, or how can it be used to develop further designs in a particular area?&#x20;



## Bill of Materials

Stuff to buy. The BOM should include everything necessary to make the components in the next section, design files.

You can use this space for any additional descriptions of the materials used.

## Validation and Characterization

Demonstrate the operation of the hardware and characterize its performance for a specific application.

* Highlight a relevant use case.
* If possible, characterize performance of the hardware over operational parameters.
* Create a bulleted list describing the capabilities (and limitations) of the hardware.  For example, load and operation time, spin speed, coefficient of variation, accuracy, precision, etc
