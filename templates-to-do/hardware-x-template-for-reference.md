# Hardware X Template (for reference)



\


1\.  Hardware in context

Write a short description of the hardware and provide context, i.e., describe similar open hardware and proprietary equipment in the field.

\


2\.  Hardware description

Describe your hardware, highlighting the customization rather than the steps involved in the procedure. Explain how  it  differs  from  other  hardware  and  the  advantages  it  offers  over  pre-existing  methods.  For  example,  how does this hardware compare to other hardware in terms of cost or ease of use, or how can it be used to develop further designs in a particular area?&#x20;

Add 3-5 bullet points which broadly explain to other researchers - inside or outside of the original user community - how the hardware could help them, with either standard or novel laboratory tasks.

\


Design files

Your design files should be editable - see OSHWA’s open source definition of ‘Documentation’ for further details. You must then either:

* Upload your design files to one of the three approved online repositories - Mendeley Data (instructions), the  Open  Science  Framework  (instructions)  or  Zenodo  (instructions).  We  recommend  this  option  as  the repositories support versioning of files.
* Upload your design files as supplementary materials (e.g., CAD files, videos. . . )  to Hardware X’s online editorial system when you submit your manuscript.
* Include your design files in the body of the manuscript (e.g., as figures).

\


CAD files:

You are encouraged to use free and open source software packages for creating the  files.  For  CAD files, OpenSCAD, FreeCAD, or Blender  are  encouraged, but, if these are  not  available, we accept source files from proprietary CAD packages, such as Autocad or Solidworks, and other drawing packages.

\


3D printing:

Supplementary files that facilitate digital replication of the devices are encouraged; for example, STL files for 3D printing components. We recommend uploading CAD files to the NIH 3D Print Exchange as Custom Labware and then entering the link here.

\


Electronics:

PCB layouts and other electronics design files can be uploaded to the Open Hardware  Repository or other repositories or as supplementary materials.

\


Software and firmware:

All software files used in the design and operation of the hardware should be included in the repository. Provide a description of the software and firmware and use extensive comments in the code.&#x20;

\


3\.  Design files summary

Complete a separate row for each design file associated with your hardware (including the primary design files). Any empty rows should be deleted.

\

| For  example: Design file 1 | E.g. CAD  file, figures, videos | All designs must be submitted under an open hardware license.  Enter the corresponding open source license for the file | Either enter    the    URL for the  repository  or  the  sentence: ”Available with the article”. |

\


\


For each design file listed in the summary table above, include a short description of the file below (just one or two sentences per design file).

\


Bill of materials

If  your  bill  of  materials  is  long  or  complex,  you  can  upload  the  details  in  an  editable  spreadsheet, e.g., ODS file type, Excel spreadsheet or PDF file, to an open access online location, such as the Open Science Framework repository.  Include the link here.  Alternatively, the bill of materials can be submitted alongside your manuscript as supplementary material.

\


\


4\.  Bill of materials summary

Complete  a  separate  row  for  each  component  of  your  hardware  –  all  components  associated  with  a  cost  should be listed and any empty rows should be deleted.

You can use this space for any additional descriptions of the materials used.

\


\


5\.  Build instructions

Provide detailed, step-by-step construction instructions for the submitted hardware:

* Include all necessary information for reproducing it.
* Explain and (when possible) characterize design decisions.  Include any design alternatives you created.
* Use visual instructions such as schematics, images and videos.
* Clearly reference design files and component parts described in the Design file summary and the Bill of materials summary
* Highlight any potential safety concerns.

\


6\.  Operation instructions

Provide detailed, step-by-step instructions for the safe and proper operation of the hardware.

* Use visual instructions, as necessary.
* Highlight any potential safety hazards.

\


7\.  Validation and characterization

* Highlight a relevant use case.
* If possible, characterize performance of the hardware over operational parameters.
* Create a bulleted list describing the capabilities (and limitations) of the hardware.  For example, load and operation time, spin speed, coefficient of variation, accuracy, precision, etc
